Green IT Box


Green IT Box is "a private cloud solution in a box" that replaces conventional hardware and infrastructure with virtual desktops, servers and networking. It includes advanced features that provide more reliability and flexibility than traditional IT systems including:

* Auto provisioning of servers/desktops,
* Built in fully redundant storage SAN,
* 15 minute snapshotting
* Golden image technology
* Virtual Private Datacenter
* and much more!
Green IT Box enables traditional SMB focused resellers to port existing client-server business applications to a cloud infrastructure which can remain either on the premises or within a shared datacenter.

Green IT Box scales easily by adding additional cloud CPU or cloud storage nodes without service interruption!
