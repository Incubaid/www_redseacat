h2. Ocean Diva

The Ocean Diva is a fast, stylish, and modern catamaran. With its low draft, it can enter into very shallow reefs. You will sail in front of [El Gouna|http://www.elgouna.com/] or [Port Ghalib|http://www.portghalib.com/], and anchor nearby for swimming and first-class snorkeling among shoals of colorful fish. The skipper and crew will look after your every need, from supplying food and drinks, to setting you up with snorkeling gear, and offering a helping hand when you need to climb back on board.

An extremely comfortable boat, even during rough sea conditions, you can laze in the sun and enjoy the fantastic views as you sail. There are also plenty of seats in the shade, as well as nets for sunbathing directly over the Red Sea. And since the Ocean Diva cuts through the water using only its sails it makes very little noise to disturb your nap!
