h3. Enabling the Telco Cloud

We enable telcos and service providers to compete in the evolving cloud market.

Telco`s are under pressure from:

* SMS and voice revenue being usurped by free messaging solutions.
* Roaming fees being slashed by the European Commission.
* Increased investments for infrastructure and FTTH.
* Increased bandwidth hogging usage (video streaming, cloud storage, â€¦).

And they are now missing the boat on cloud:

* Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc. are eating their lunch.
* They drive customers from the desktop to the proprietary vendor cloud.

Saudi Cloud brings both the strategy and the solutions to the telcos in order to lead them towards competitive cloud offerings. Saudi Cloud delivers a unique technology cloud stack that is not available to other players. This cloud stack is already implemented at several telcos.

This cloud stack features:

* Same reliability and scalability as big boys in cloud like Amazon & Google
* More cost effective than public cloud market leaders
* Ultra green approach saving 90% power compared to traditional solutions
* Usable in private context as well as in public cloud context
* Integrates desktop, archive & IAAS enduser experience in 1 stack
* Ready to be deployed in Telco context in emerging markets TODAY
