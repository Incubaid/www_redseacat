    Who said that you have to be a professional diver, or even know how to swim to be able to enjoy the amazing underwater scenery of the Red Sea? Comfortably seated in a slowly cruising glass bottomed boat, you can explore underwater treasures. You'll be amazed by the water clarity, the richness of the corals underneath and the marine life diversity on such a shallow level.

    Apart from being quite cheap, the trip is a perfect family attraction; children, parents and elderly people will all enjoy it equally. It is also the perfect occasion to make great souvenir pictures; on your way back to shore you'll be able to strike the pose with a beautiful panoramic view of the coast in the background.
