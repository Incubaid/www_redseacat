      <p> The Ocean Divas are fast, stylish, and modern catamarans. With their low drafts, they can enter into very shallow reefs. Sailing in front of El Gouna or Port Ghalib, and anchor at beautiful reefs for swimming and first-class snorkeling among shoals of colorful fish. The skipper and crew will look after your every need, from supplying food and drinks, to setting you up with snorkeling gear, and offering a helping hand when you need to climb back on board.
        The Ocean Diva's are extremely comfortable boats, even during rough sea conditions, you can laze in the sun and enjoy the fantastic views as you sail. There are also plenty of seats in the shade, as well as nets for sunbathing directly over the Red Sea. And since the Ocean Diva's are cutting through the water using only their sails it makes very little noise to disturb your nap! </p>
