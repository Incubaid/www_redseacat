      The Ocean Divas are fast, stylish and modern catamarans. Their low drafts allow us to explore the reefs of El Gouna and Port Ghalib in comfort and style!

We’ll take you to the most exciting spots in the Red Sea to experience first class swimming and snorkeling among shoals of colourful fish and beautiful reefs.

 

Our Skipper and crew will take care of your every need with a full range of snorkel equipment, delicious food and drink and all the safety equipment you’ll need to experience the best of the Red Sea in comfort.

 

The Ocean Divas are famed for their unparalleled comfort and smooth sailing.

Chill out in the shade or soak up the sun on our huge nets overhanging the water.

Want to help the crew? No problem! Our team are always willing to “show you the ropes”

 

Experience true sailing as we hoist the main sail and let nature power our journey.

You will get up close and personal with all the Red Sea has to offer with regular Dolphin sightings, sea turtles and dugongs to name but a few.
 

Ocean Diva, the ultimate Red Sea experience!
